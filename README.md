# EDA Project - King County Housing

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that I worked on during the neuefische Data Science bootcamp. The project is split into six Jupyter notebooks and summarized in a presentation.

Please use the following commands before running the notebooks:

```Bash
pyenv local 3.9.8
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
